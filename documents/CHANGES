=========
- Uses .throw rather than error for error macro which behaved oddly in 64tass
- I/O added ASCII out, which is used by the interpreter and can convert to upper case (say)
  and normal out, which is used for PRINT, INPUT etc. Fix for default CBM character set issues.
- Add Get$() and Inkey$()
- Break now works on Get$(),Get() and Input (if it is turned on)
- Added Mem function
