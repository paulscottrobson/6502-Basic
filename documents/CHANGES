Changes
=======

This is a list of changes made post release 0.14 (prior to that it was too fluid)

It is not practical yet to keep code in binary (e.g. tokenised) form because the token values
vary too much. Text source only.

12/3/2021
=========
- Uses .throw rather than error for error macro which behaved oddly in 64tass
- I/O added ASCII out, which is used by the interpreter and can convert to upper case (say)
  and normal out, which is used for PRINT, INPUT etc. Fix for default CBM character set issues.
- Add Get$() and Inkey$()
- Break now works on Get$(),Get() and Input (if it is turned on)
- Added Mem function
- Added out of memory checks.
- Added number stack overflow check.
- BUG: X1/X2 instructions were chewing up the stack (jump to execute rather than rts)

13/3/2021
=========
- LIST now indents structures/procedures.
- BUG: Structure Scanner moving forward to next line was using Y=0 not Y=3, causing spurious 
	   scanning and indenting.
- VLOAD very simple implementation no compression etc.

14/3/2021
=========
- Worked on analysis of 65C02 Opcodes
- Table and Token generators now produce tables/constants for Assembler.
- Put empty hooks in run to link to assembler module.

15/3/2021
=========
- VLOAD no longer defaults so VRAM files can be chunked if required, so VRAM addr/type etc. must be initialised
  initial load and data type.
- Assembler is complete and working, but obviously very alpha :)

16/3/2021
=========
- Assembler compiles all 65C02 instructions correctly
- More code reviews
- BUG: asl &34 lists and retokenises properly.
- tokenisers_tokenise does not use CS/CC to return success/fail.
- Version 0.16

17/3/2021
=========
- Reorganised the source files and added option for "unused"
- DIM works with multiple array indices, but you can't access them yet :)
- Tidied up array create. Had AZN vaccine today and it's made me a bit dozy.

18/3/2021
=========
- Written access code for multidimensional arrays & tested it.
- Added Mode which squeezes the screen set up into a 32 bit integer (which has simple versions)
- Added code to reset the mode back to zero when entering warm mode.

19/3/2021
=========
- Added MODE and PALETTE

20/3/2021
=========
- Coldstart forces correct mode as well
