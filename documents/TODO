TODO
====
Check the interface and make it more stable. Must use X as entrance value. $80-$FF for user functions
$00-7F for system functions. All modules must work like this.
Add automatic calls to initialise/closedown for modules.
Check documentation.

Known Bugs
==========

	Tokeniser/Detokeniser needs to support % and a default type, which is hard coded at present.

	DATA in odd places in structures won't work. May need own scanner.

Incomplete but hooked in for write and test
===========================================
	Special case 1 character in concrete ???

	All floating point operations.

	Three dispatchers - 2 in run.asm and 1 in extensionhandler.asm which use jmp (a,x)
	need 6502 versions along with dispatch macro.

Notes
=====

New commands/Changes to document
