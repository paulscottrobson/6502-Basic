TODO
====

- Draw sprite on bitmap various scales ? Font ?

Something like AMOS's Animation thing, animate basic movement, destroy ?

Known Bugs
==========
	Tokeniser/Detokeniser needs to support % and a default type, which is hard coded at present.

	DATA in odd places in structures won't work. May need own scanner.

Incomplete but hooked in for write and test
===========================================
	Special case 1 character in concrete ???

	All floating point operations. Note Shift-3 dispatches automatically to 
	extension. Needs cross dispatch to FP routines ?

	Three dispatchers - 2 in run.asm and 1 in extensionhandler.asm which use jmp (a,x)
	need 6502 versions along with dispatch macro.
