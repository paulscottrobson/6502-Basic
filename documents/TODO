Known Bugs
==========
	Tokeniser/Detokeniser needs to support % and a default type, which is hard coded at present.

	DATA in odd places in structures won't work. May need own scanner.

Incomplete but hooked in for write and test
===========================================
	Special case 1 character in concrete ???

	All floating point operations. Note Shift-3 dispatches automatically to 
	extension. Needs cross dispatch to FP routines ?
