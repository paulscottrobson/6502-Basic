TODO
====

Strings need concrete assignment.
	- reuse of old space.
	- null concreting
	- single character concreting.
	- only concrete if in soft memory space.

	Test using additives.

Add str$() val() isval() with bases 2-16 for integer. isval() returns error on val()

Add proc defproc endproc code. Design localisation for parameters and initialisation.

Implement VPEEK/VPOKE and put those links in to run $82/$83 words and check they work.

Add arrays.

Incomplete but hooked in for write and test
===========================================

	FP Import from token, int/float conversions, add/sub/mul/div/compare, negate, load and store.
	Out of memory in pointer advance in clear.asm alloc, soft memory allocation alloc() function.

Notes
=====
	Stack position fudged for readability.
	When calling parameters reset softalloc before every param, they might all be concreted strings.
