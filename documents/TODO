TODO
====
String unary and support (concat, compare etc.) when testing framework up
Complete functions, operators.

L-Expr routine & Assignment, and implement GOTO at some point, so we can get a rough speed test :)

Incomplete but hooked in for write and test
===========================================
	Default Let on run
	How handle !<term> ?<term> on LHS (require LET)
	Variable Access (long variables)
	Unimplemented keywords causes break.
	String Concatenation, Compare
	FP Import from token, int/float conversions, add/sub/mul/div/compare, negate
	Miscellaneous unary funcs.
	Token handler for $83 in unary.
	Out of memory in pointer advance in clear.asm

Notes
=====
	Stack position fudged for readability.
