VRAM Data File Format
=====================

2 byte header (dummy)

00000xxx xxxxxxxx 		2 byte instruction, sets the write address to x x 64.

00001nnn 				Set decompression type to nnn. 

001bhhww nnnnnnnn 		Define sprite data as being here (alignd to 32 bytes automatically)
						wwhh is size (as defined in Vera docs)
						b is the mode bit (0 = 4 bit,1 = 8 bit.)
						4 bit sprites are expected to use the standard palette (240-255)
						8 bit sprites obviously use the whole palette.

10000000 				End of data.

1nnnnnnn 				Block of data size n bytes follows, using current compression,
						expand at current address.
