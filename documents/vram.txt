VRAM Data File Format
=====================

2 byte header (dummy)

00000xxx xxxxxxxx 		2 byte instruction, sets the write address to x x 64.

00001nnn 				Set decompression type to nnn. 

00001111 				Palette definition. Next byte is palette index, followed by two byte
						colour in Vera Format. This changes the write address, so should be either first
						or last.

001bhhww nnnnnnnn 		Define sprite data image n as being here (aligned to 32 bytes automatically)
						wwhh is size (as defined in Vera docs)
						b is the mode bit (0 = 4 bit,1 = 8 bit.)
						4 bit sprites are expected to use the standard palette (240-255)
						8 bit sprites obviously use the whole palette.

10000000 				End of data.

Compression Model 0 (uncompressed)
==================================
1nnnnnnn 				Block of data size n bytes follows.


Compression Model 1 (Simple RLE compression)
============================================
10nnnnnn 				Followed by n bytes of data
11cccccc 				Followed by cccccc copies of the following byte.
